Landing Page is a project in the Odin Project curiculum. It's a Landing Page about something.

The CSS is messy I will come back later and modify it. If this message is still here I'm an idiot and I never came back.

Maybe not the best semantics and CSS but for now I will focus on get the result the most accurate visually.

When I will finish the Curiculum I will come back and modify everything.
