Landing Page is a project in the Odin Project curiculum for the HTML and CSS only part. It's a Landing Page about something, with an information panel, a famous quote and a sign up panel.

I just use HTML and CSS with some flexbox.

It's maybe not the best semantics and CSS but for now I will focus on get the result the most accurate visually.

Note for myself : I still have issues to get an image responsive like I would, and to be exactly how I want in a flexbox. In this example it's almost alright not sure for the main photo.
